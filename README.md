August 27, 1859, at a depth of 23 meters, the precious liquid finally began to flow. With the help of a pump, Drake's men started the extraction: on the first day of work they already filled 25 barrels.

In 2021, barrels of crude oil continue to be extracted and there are still many years of extraction, but the conversion to electric vehicles is a present and future reality.

The objective of BARRELCRUDECOIN, to be the link between classical oil extraction and electric crude extraction. 

This currency will be the new fuel for your electric vehicle,
with an ultra-fast payment system with the mobile App.

You can recharge the batteries of your electric vehicle at gas stations 
and pay comfortably with your mobile phone.
